# Code Everything

It is said that the deepest mastery of a subject comes from being able to teach
it. I argue similarly for any concept that can be programmed. Deep mastery of
such concepts comes from programming them ourselves. Programming is, in a sense,
teaching computers.

In this text, we work through the fundamentals of computer vision by coding them
all on our own. At first, we use no supplementary software libraries. We later
take on libraries only after we have implemented some functionality of them
ourselves. In this way, we can more deeply appreciate the convenience the
software libraries provide and also have a deep technical understanding of what
the libraries are doing behind their APIs.

# About the Author

I am a computer engineer by education and a software engineer by profession. I
have mostly focused on embedded and systems programming in my career to date
(2021). I had the opportunity join a machine learning team for perception in
autonomous vehicles, and my interest in computer vision and machine learning led
me to pursue that opportunity. With no formal background in or experience with
computer vision, I had to teach myself on the job and after hours. This text is
a result of my journey, prepared for others who may find themselves in my former
shoes or sympathize with my approach to learning.

# Prerequisites

This text won't teach the fundamentals of computer science, nay, programming.
You may implement the material in this text using whichever language you are
most comfortable with. I will give demonstrations in Python 3. I expect the
reader to have general readability in languages like Python to follow along. In
our journey, we will use some third-party Python libraries like
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [OpenCV 2](https://opencv.org/) and also
image-manipulation software like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
